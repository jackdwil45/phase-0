#How to create a repo on GitHub and clone the repo to your local computer
In order to create a repo on GitHub and clone the repo to your local computer, you first must access the repo on the GitHub site.  Once you have selected the repo you would like to clone to your local system, locate the clone URL box.  Click the icon next to the URL box to copy the URL to your clipboard.  Next you will open up your PowerShell. In the command line you will then type git command "git clone <Clone URL>". Once the command line returns, check to make sure it worked by enter the "ls" command. If the file is there, use command "cd <git_file_name>" to navigate into the folder.

#Describe what open source means.
Open source refers to the type of licensing used for a specific software. The type of open source licensing used on some woftware will determine how the software can be shared, edited, and distributed.  Open source allows other developers access to your software while still protecting copyright.  

#What do you think about open source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia? / Assess the imporantce of licenses.
I think it is a great tool for collaboration and great for competition. In my opinion, open source would likely result in the best possible version of that code/software.  Of course there may also be instances where the original creator does not recieve his due, but using proper licensing I think it can be avoided. The license will ultimately determine if, how, and to what extent other developers can use your software. If you have made some software that could potentially be worth money, it would be imperative to establish a license that would not permit others to freely distribute, or even sell your software.

#What concepts were solidifed in the challenge? Did you have any 'aha' moments? What did you struggle with?
This challenge helped to solidify my understanding of how to create repository files locally and on github.  I did not really ave any 'aha' moments, but I did struggle at first when doing this challenge.  After getting through the first step or so, however, I remembered all the proper steps and was able to complete it with ease.
